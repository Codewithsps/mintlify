# Mintlify Documentation Website Clone

## Project Overview

This project is a **desktop-first documentation website clone** inspired by the Mintlify platform.  
The objective was to recreate the **structure, layout, and content hierarchy** of a modern documentation site with a strong focus on readability, UI consistency, and visual accuracy.

The implementation uses **pure HTML and CSS in a single file**, without any external frameworks or libraries.
